1. Introduction:
The URL Link Shortener project aims to create a simple yet effective tool for shortening long URLs.
The project uses Java for the backend logic and a Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.

2. Features:
URL Shortening: Users can input a long URL, and the application generates a shortened version using a unique code.
URL Expansion: Users can input a short URL, and the application provides the original long URL.
GUI Interface: The project includes a graphical user interface built with Java Swing for a user-friendly experience.

3. Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
GUI Framework: Java Swing
Data Storage: In-memory data structures (can be extended to a database in a real-world scenario)

4. Project Components:
URLShortener.java: The main class containing the logic for URL shortening and expanding.
URLShortenerGUI.java: The method responsible for the graphical user interface using Java Swing.
ShortURLGenerator.java: A ShortURLGenerator for generating unique short URLs.

5. Workflow:
Users interact with the GUI by entering long URLs for shortening or short URLs for expansion.
The backend logic generates and manages the short URLs.
Shortened URLs are displayed to users for easy sharing.

6. Code Overview:
The project uses in-memory maps to store the mappings between short and long URLs.
URL shortening involves generating a random short code and updating the mapping.
URL expansion involves looking up the short code to find the corresponding long URL.

7. Future Improvements:
Database Integration: Implementing a database for persistent storage of URL mappings.
Enhanced Security: Using a more sophisticated algorithm for generating short URLs.
Error Handling: Adding comprehensive error handling for user input and system failures.
User Authentication: Implementing user accounts for better tracking and management of URLs.

8. Conclusion:
The URL Link Shortener project provides a foundation for a simple URL shortening service.
It serves as an educational example that can be extended and enhanced for real-world use. 
The GUI adds a user-friendly aspect to the project, making it accessible to a wide audience.
